# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

Having never previously managed to complete the full set of 25 AoC problems, I have resolved this year to not only complete them all in Kotlin, but:

- ALSO get up every day at 5am to compete on the leaderboard,
- AND attempt to solve every question a second time in a different programming language,
- WITH the limitation that https://github.com/aDotInTheVoid and I cannot use the same one.

Only the future will tell if I will succeed at any of these goals. :P

# Progress

**Kotlin Solutions:**
19/25

**Various Language Solutions:**  
(Except for days 1 and 2, we tried to pair them up semi-logically.)

Note: I am pretty behind on this side of the challenge right now - as the days have now started to get more difficult (even in a language I am comfortable in), to keep my sanity, I'm going to focus on solving the questions in Kotlin for now and come back to these later.
