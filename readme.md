# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

Having never previously managed to complete the full set of 25 AoC problems, I have resolved this year to not only complete them all in Kotlin, but:
- ALSO get up every day at 5am to compete on the leaderboard,  
- AND attempt to solve every question a second time in a different programming language,  
- WITH the limitation that https://github.com/aDotInTheVoid and I cannot use the same one.

Only the future will tell if I will succeed at any of these goals. :P

# Progress

**Kotlin Solutions:** 
7/25

**Various Language Solutions:**  
(Except for days 1 and 2, we tried to pair them up semi-logically.)
