# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

Having never previously managed to complete the full set of 25 AoC problems, I have resolved this year to not only complete them all in Kotlin, but:

- ALSO get up every day at 5am to compete on the leaderboard,
- AND attempt to solve every question a second time in a different programming language,
- WITH the limitation that (aDotInTheVoid)[https://github.com/aDotInTheVoid] and I cannot use the same one.

Only the future will tell if I will succeed at any of these goals. :P

EDIT:

The future has indeed told me... that I succeeded at one of them. COBOL was just too much.

# Progress

**Kotlin Solutions:**
25/25

**Various Language Solutions:**

| Day | aDotInTheVoid's Pick | My Pick      | Done?  |
| --- | -------------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| 1   | C#                   | x86 Assembly | Yes    |
| 2   | Clojure              | Nim          | Yes    |
| 3   | Fortran              | COBOL        | Part A |
| 4   | R                    | Desmos       | Yes    |

... at this point I gave up, lol. Here's hoping I will manage to use a few more interesting langs next year!
